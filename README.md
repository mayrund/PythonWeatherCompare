#Python Weather Compare

## Introduction
PythonWeatherCompare is a shell script for comparing weather conditions (temperature) between two or more locations in your terminal.  
The script was written by Mayrun Digmi (mayrun@gmail.com) and uses public data from the `OpenWeatherMap` free weather API.

## Requirements
PythonWeatherCompare requires the following:
  - Python 2.7.x interupter (http://www.python.org/getit/)
  - Internet connection

## Python dependencies

The PythonWeatherCompare script depends on the following python packages, most of these should be included in Python by default.
  - json
  - urllib2
  - pprint

If when you try to run the Python update client the first time, you recieve errors reporting of missing modules, you should be able to install them like so:

`easy_install json`

Repeat the above example for each of the missing packages.

## Configuration
Configuration is pretty simple, all you have to do is open compareWeather.py with your favorite editor and edit the **cities** variable.

## Usage
When configuration is done, run the script from the command line:

` $ ./compareWeather.py `

PythonWeatherCompare is distributed under the GPL V3 license. See `LICENSE` file for details.
